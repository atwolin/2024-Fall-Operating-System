# MP1: NachOS Thread Management

## Purpose

This project implements basic thread management functionality in the NachOS (Not Another Completely Heuristic Operating System) educational operating system. The focus is on understanding and implementing fundamental thread operations, synchronization primitives, and thread scheduling mechanisms.

## Key Objectives

- Implement thread creation, deletion, and management
- Develop thread synchronization mechanisms (locks, semaphores, condition variables)
- Understand thread scheduling and context switching
- Implement basic thread safety and mutual exclusion



# MP2: NachOS Process Management and System Calls

## Purpose

This project extends NachOS to support user-level processes and system calls. Students will implement the interface between user programs and the operating system kernel, including process creation, memory management, and basic I/O operations.

## Key Objectives

- Implement system call interface and handling
- Develop process creation and termination mechanisms
- Implement memory management for user processes
- Add support for file I/O operations through system calls
- Understand virtual memory concepts and address translation



# MP3: NachOS Virtual Memory Management

## Purpose

This project implements a virtual memory system in NachOS, including demand paging, page replacement algorithms, and translation lookaside buffers (TLB). Students will understand how modern operating systems manage memory efficiently through virtual memory techniques.

## Key Objectives

- Implement demand paging with page fault handling
- Develop page replacement algorithms (FIFO, LRU, etc.)
- Implement Translation Lookaside Buffer (TLB) management
- Add support for memory mapping and shared memory
- Understand virtual memory performance optimizations



# MP4: NachOS File System Implementation

## Purpose

This project implements a complete file system in NachOS, including directory structures, file allocation methods, and file system reliability features. Students will understand how modern file systems organize and manage persistent storage.

## Key Objectives

- Implement hierarchical directory structures
- Develop file allocation and storage management
- Add file system journaling and crash recovery
- Implement file system caching and buffering
- Understand file system performance and reliability



# Pthread Programming Assignment

## Purpose

This project focuses on multi-threaded programming using POSIX threads (pthreads). Students will implement a producer-consumer pipeline system with thread synchronization, load balancing, and performance optimization using mutex locks, condition variables, and thread-safe data structures.

## Key Objectives

- Master pthread programming and thread management
- Implement thread-safe data structures and synchronization primitives
- Develop producer-consumer patterns with multiple stages
- Implement dynamic load balancing and performance monitoring
- Understand thread synchronization and coordination mechanisms
